# Polymers as random and self-avoiding walks
Monte Carlo simulation of random walks, self-avoiding walks by simple sampling and self-avoiding walks by biased sampling for studying end-to-end distance and exponent p=2*nu.

* **randwalk.py** - a random walker class.
* **saw.py** - a self-avoiding walker class (simple sampling).
* **biased.py** - a self-avoiding walker class (biased sampling).
* **analysis.py** - Monte Carlo simulation of walks. Calculation of exponent p=2*nu.
* **entropy.py** - Analysis of absolute dimensionless entropy per monomer for different N, with exponential and linear curve fit.
